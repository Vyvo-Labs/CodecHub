# Descript Audio Codec (DAC)

DAC (Descript Audio Codec) is a high-fidelity neural audio codec designed for efficient audio compression and reconstruction. It uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) approach with residual vector quantization to achieve high-quality audio at low bitrates.

## Overview

DAC provides state-of-the-art audio compression using deep learning techniques. It's designed to maintain audio quality while achieving significant compression ratios, making it ideal for applications requiring efficient audio storage and transmission.

## Architecture

DAC uses an encoder-decoder architecture with several key innovations:

- **Encoder**: Converts raw audio into compressed latent representations
- **Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ)**: Multi-level quantization for better reconstruction
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs high-quality audio from quantized representations
- **Discriminators**: Ensure perceptually accurate reconstruction

### Key Features

- **High Compression Ratios**: Achieves significant size reduction with minimal quality loss
- **Perceptual Quality**: Optimized for human auditory perception
- **Multi-Scale Processing**: Handles different frequency components effectively
- **Real-time Capable**: Efficient inference for streaming applications

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from codecplus import load_codec
from codecplus.utils import load_audio, save_audio

# Load audio
audio, sr = load_audio('input.wav')

# Initialize DAC
dac = load_codec('dac', sample_rate=44100, n_mels=80)

# Encode audio to latent representation
latents = dac.encode(audio)
print(f"Latent shape: {latents.shape}")

# Decode latents back to audio
reconstructed_audio = dac.decode(latents)

# Save reconstructed audio
save_audio(reconstructed_audio, 'output.wav', sr)
```

### Analyzing Compression Performance

```python
# Calculate compression metrics
original_size = audio.size * audio.itemsize
compressed_size = latents.size * latents.itemsize
compression_ratio = original_size / compressed_size

print(f"Original size: {original_size / 1024:.2f} KB")
print(f"Compressed size: {compressed_size / 1024:.2f} KB")
print(f"Compression ratio: {compression_ratio:.2f}x")
```

### Configuration Options

```python
# Initialize with custom parameters
dac = load_codec('dac', 
                sample_rate=48000,    # Target sample rate
                n_mels=128,           # Mel spectrogram bins
                hop_length=256,       # STFT hop length
                win_length=1024)      # STFT window length
```
